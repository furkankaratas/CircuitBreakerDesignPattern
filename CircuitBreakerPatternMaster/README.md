# CircuitBreaker.Net
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexandrnikitin/CircuitBreaker.Net.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexandrnikitin/CircuitBreaker.Net) [![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/CircuitBreaker.Net.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/CircuitBreaker.Net)

## Overview

`CircuitBreaker.Net` is an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern for .NET.
This pattern can improve the stability and resiliency of your application, especially in SOAP, microservices and distributed environments. The pattern serves two main purposes: to isolate communication with third-party services, so that your application won't be affected by their fails. And to react to third-party services' fails: it could be a pause, throttling, fail-over, default behavior, etc.  
You can read about the pattern [on MSDN][MSDN] or from [Martin Fowler][fowler].

## Install

It's available via [a nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CircuitBreaker.Net)  
PM> `Install-Package CircuitBreaker.Net`

## Example Usage

```csharp
// Initialize the circuit breaker
var circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(
    TaskScheduler.Default,
    maxFailures: 3,
    invocationTimeout: TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(100),
    circuitResetTimeout: TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(10000));

try
{
    // perform a potentially fragile call through the circuit breaker
    circuitBreaker.Execute(externalService.Call);
    // or its async version
    // await circuitBreaker.ExecuteAsync(externalService.CallAsync);
}
catch (CircuitBreakerOpenException)
{
    // the service is unavailable, failover here
}
catch (CircuitBreakerTimeoutException)
{
    // handle timeouts
}
catch (Exception)
{
    // handle other unexpected exceptions
}

```

## Why?

There are [not so many of them][nuget-curcuitbreaker]. I didn't find any that would suit me. [Polly][polly] seems the most mature from all of them but it has a locking nature and it doesn't provide a way to specify a separate `TaskScheduler` to execute actions. But that's a crucial aspect when you call a third-party service, because those calls could stuff your "main" `TaskScheduler`. Actually none of those libraries support injection of a `TaskScheduler`. `Helpful.CircuitBreaker` by RokitSalad isn't thread safe. `CircuitBreaker` by kylos101 executes actions on the same thread. `ManagedCircuitBreaker` by AsherW is a fork of `Polly` with emphasize on IoC containers. The code provided on MSDN isn't production ready and just a piece of code. And so on so forth. So that the yet another library was born. I hope you will find it helpful. :wink:
